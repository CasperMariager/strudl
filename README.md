# STRUDL: Surveillance Tracking Using Deep Learning

STRUDL is an open-source and free framework for tracking objects visible from static surveillance cameras. It uses a deep learining object detector, camera calibration and tracking to create trajectories of e.g. road users, in world coordinates. It provides a Web UI that attempts to make it easy to use, even without too much knowledge in computer vision and deep learning. It uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for sandboxing and handling dependencies, to make installation easier.

### Requirements

1. A Linux computer with a powerful, modern NVidia GPU
2. [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
